The `BLSApkRegistry` tracks the current aggregate BLS pubkey for all Operators registered to each quorum, and keeps a historical record of each quorum's aggregate BLS pubkey hash. This contract makes heavy use of the `BN254` library to perform various operations on the BN254 elliptic curve (see [`BN254.sol`](../../src/libraries/BN254.sol)).

Each time an Operator registers for a quorum, its BLS pubkey is added to that quorum's `currentApk`. Each time an Operator deregisters from a quorum, its BLS pubkey is subtracted from that quorum's `currentApk`. This contract maintains a history of the hash of each quorum's apk over time, which is used by the `BLSSignatureChecker` to fetch the "total signing key" for a quorum at a specific block number.

#### High-level Concepts

This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
* [Registering and Deregistering](#registering-and-deregistering)
* [System Configuration](#system-configuration)

### Registering and Deregistering

These methods are ONLY called through the `RegistryCoordinator` - when an Operator registers for or deregisters from one or more quorums:
* [`registerBLSPublicKey`](#registerblspublickey)
* [`registerOperator`](#registeroperator)
* [`deregisterOperator`](#deregisteroperator)

#### `registerBLSPublicKey`

```solidity
function registerBLSPublicKey(
    address operator,
    PubkeyRegistrationParams calldata params,
    BN254.G1Point calldata pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash
) 
    external 
    onlyRegistryCoordinator 
    returns (bytes32 operatorId)

struct PubkeyRegistrationParams {
    BN254.G1Point pubkeyRegistrationSignature;
    BN254.G1Point pubkeyG1;
    BN254.G2Point pubkeyG2;
}
```

This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`. It is called when an Operator registers for the AVS for the first time.

This method validates a BLS signature over the `pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash`, then permanently assigns the pubkey to the Operator. The hash of `params.pubkeyG1` becomes the Operator's unique `operatorId`, which identifies the Operator throughout the registry contracts.

*Entry Points*:
* `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
* `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`

*Effects*:
* Registers the Operator's BLS pubkey for the first time, updating the following mappings:
    * `operatorToPubkey[operator]`
    * `operatorToPubkeyHash[operator]`
    * `pubkeyHashToOperator[pubkeyHash]`

*Requirements*:
* Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
* `params.pubkeyG1` MUST NOT hash to the `ZERO_PK_HASH`
* `operator` MUST NOT have already registered a pubkey:
    * `operatorToPubkeyHash[operator]` MUST be zero
    * `pubkeyHashToOperator[pubkeyHash]` MUST be zero
* `params.pubkeyRegistrationSignature` MUST be a valid signature over `pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash`

#### `registerOperator`

```solidity
function registerOperator(
    address operator,
    bytes memory quorumNumbers
) 
    public 
    virtual 
    onlyRegistryCoordinator
```

`registerOperator` fetches the Operator's registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above). Then, for each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, the Operator's pubkey is added to that quorum's `currentApk`. The `apkHistory` for the `quorumNumber` is also updated to reflect this change.

This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator registers for one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that `operator` is not already registered for any of `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.

*Entry Points*:
* `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
* `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`

*Effects*:
* For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
    * Add the Operator's pubkey to the quorum's apk in `currentApk[quorum]`
    * Updates the quorum's `apkHistory`, pushing a new `ApkUpdate` for the current block number and setting its `apkHash` to the new hash of `currentApk[quorum]`.
        * *Note:* If the most recent entry in `apkHistory[quorum]` was made during the current block, this method updates the most recent entry rather than pushing a new one.

*Requirements*:
* Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
* `operator` MUST already have a registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above) 
* Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)

#### `deregisterOperator`

```solidity
function deregisterOperator(
    address operator,
    bytes memory quorumNumbers
) 
    public 
    virtual 
    onlyRegistryCoordinator
```

`deregisterOperator` fetches the Operator's registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above). For each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, `deregisterOperator` performs the same steps as `registerOperator` above - except that the Operator's pubkey is negated. Whereas `registerOperator` "adds" a pubkey to each quorum's apk, `deregisterOperator` "subtracts" a pubkey from each quorum's apk.

This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator deregisters from one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that `operator` is registered for all quorums in `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.

*Entry Points*:
* `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
* `RegistryCoordinator.deregisterOperator`
* `RegistryCoordinator.ejectOperator`
* `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators`
* `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum`

*Effects*:
* For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
    * Negate the Operator's pubkey, then subtract it from the quorum's apk in `currentApk[quorum]`
    * Updates the quorum's `apkHistory`, pushing a new `ApkUpdate` for the current block number and setting its `apkHash` to the new hash of `currentApk[quorum]`.
        * *Note:* If the most recent entry in `apkHistory[quorum]` was made during the current block, this method updates the most recent entry rather than pushing a new one.

*Requirements*:
* Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
* `operator` MUST already have a registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above)
* Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)

### System Configuration

#### `initializeQuorum`

```solidity
function initializeQuorum(
    uint8 quorumNumber
) 
    public 
    virtual 
    onlyRegistryCoordinator
```

This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`. It is called when the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner creates a new quorum.

`initializeQuorum` initializes a new quorum by pushing an initial `ApkUpdate` to `apkHistory[quorumNumber]`. Other methods can validate that a quorum exists by checking whether `apkHistory[quorumNumber]` has a nonzero length.

*Entry Points*:
* `RegistryCoordinator.createQuorum`

*Effects*:
* Pushes an `ApkUpdate` to `apkHistory[quorumNumber]`. The update has a zeroed out `apkHash`, and its `updateBlockNumber` is set to the current block.

*Requirements*:
* Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
* `apkHistory[quorumNumber].length` MUST be zero
